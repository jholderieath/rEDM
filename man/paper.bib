@article{Pendell2010,
abstract = {We examine the impacts of adopting animal identification and tracing systems on the U.S. meat and livestock industry. Using a multimarket equilibrium displacement model, we find that a modest increase in domestic demand for beef would offset the costs of an animal identification system. Similarly, an increase in beef export demand equivalent to Japan's beef export market share prior to the 2003 U.S. discovery of bovine spongiform encephalopathy would offset animal identification system costs.},

@article{Okrent2012a,
abstract = {Many commentators claim that farm subsidies have contributed significantly to the “obesity epidemic” by making fattening foods relatively cheap and abundant and, symmetrically, that taxing “unhealthy” commodities or subsidizing “healthy” commodities would contribute to reducing obesity rates. In this articleweuseanequilibrium displacementmodelto estimateandcomparethe economic welfare effects from a range of hypothetical farm commodity and retail food policies as alternative mechanisms for encouraging consumption of healthy food or discouraging consumption of unhealthy food, or both.We find that, compared with retail taxes on fat, sugar, or all food, or subsidies on fruits and vegetables at the farm or retail levels, a tax on calories would be the most efficient obesity policy.A tax on calories would have the lowest deadweight loss per pound of fat reduction in average adult weight, and would yield a net social gain once the impact on public health care expenditures is considered},

@article{Nogueira2015,
abstract = {We calculate the welfare effects of the Washington State University (WSU) wheat breeding programs for producers and consumers in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and the United States, and for importers of U.S. wheat. We develop a partial equilibrium multiregion, multiproduct, multivariety trade model for wheat that provides consumer, producer, and total surplus for each wheat class and region. Our results provide evidence suggesting that WSU wheat breeding programs have increased welfare for the state of Washington, the United States, and importers of U.S. wheat.},
